# HTML-CSS-JS
Write a single HTML5 page called "question1.html" that meets the following criteria:
 
You must include all code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript within ONE HTML document, do not add any external files). 

1. Title of the page is "Question 1 by first_name last_name". Where first_name and last_name is your name. 
2. The page has an icon, specifically the "home" described in the Google public icons found here: Icons - Google Fonts 
3. The page has a meta sections in the header for: author's name (your name), description of the page, and 3 keywords (you can pick anything relevant for these).
4. When the page first loads, an alert message should pop up with the message "Welcome to Question 1". The user would click "ok" and the message will disappear. It will then prompt the user to enter his/her first name. Make sure the first name is all alpha characters and not empty.
5. The page will have three div sections as follows:
  5.1. The first div will contain the current date and time horizontally centered, in the format as per this example: Wednesday, August 17, 2022 08:07:34 pm. The clock will be refreshing every second with the udpated date/time followed by the first name that you entered from part (4) above: "John is logged in" (where you replace "John" with the actual first name from the user from (4). 
  5.2. The second div will contain a label and a textbox called seedInput, that by default contains a random digit between 0 and 9. The user may enter a different digit, but if an invalid digit is entered then the textbox value will automatically revert to the previous valid number. e.g. if the initial number was 5, and the user enters 'a', then the textbox will revert back to '5'. If the user enters a valid digit like 7, then the value will be accepted to 7. 
5.3. The third div will contain a table that displays the multiplication table values of the seedInput. For instance, if the seedInput is 5, the table will look like this (horizontally centered, same formatting as below with a gray background for alternating rows). The output will change accordingly based on the seedInput value that the user can
manipulate:

Note that the multiplication table will change automatically when the user changes the value of seedInput.
6. Make sure the page is a valid HTML5 according to the W3C checker without any warnings or errors.
